## Branching Policy

- All large changes should be done via branching
    - Keep branches focused and limited in scope, to allow merging them quickly and efficiently
- Features should be prefixed with `feature/`
- Bug fixes should be prefixed with `bugfix/`
- Merge requests should be filed against `dev`
    - At the end of each sprint, `dev` will be merged into `main`
- Merge requests should be approved by at least 1 other person before merging
