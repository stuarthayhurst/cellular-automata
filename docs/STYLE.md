## Style Guide

- **Exposed symbols and interfaces must be annotated with a JSDoc comment**
- All source files will be formatted with **Prettier** following `.prettierrc`:
    - HTML & CSS indentation is 2 spaces
    - JavaScript indentation is 4 spaces
    - Semicolons at the end of every statement
    - Double quotes rather than single quotes
- Use camel case for function and variable names, e.g. `viewMode`, `togglePaused`
- Use pascal case for types, e.g. `StateModel`
